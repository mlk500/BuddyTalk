# BuddyTalk

BuddyTalk is a voice-first conversational prototype for young children (ages 3–8), designed to support natural spoken English practice through interaction with a friendly character.

The project explores how children can engage in free conversation without reading or typing, while the system provides natural, supportive responses.

> 🚧 **Project status:** This repository contains an early-stage prototype.  
> Some components are still under development.

## Current Prototype Scope

At this stage, the project focuses on establishing a working **voice interaction pipeline**, which will later be connected to an intelligent conversational component.

### Implemented:
- Browser-based **Speech-to-Text (STT)** for capturing spoken input
- Browser-based **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** for reading responses aloud
- A simple interaction loop demonstrating voice → text → voice flow

### In Progress:
- Conversational intelligence and LLM-based response generation
- Character behavior and pedagogical logic
- Full end-to-end conversational experience
